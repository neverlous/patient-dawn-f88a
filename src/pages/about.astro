		Hey there, I'm Chen Lou! I'm a web developer by profession, crafting digital experiences and building things for the web. My curiosity doesn't stop at web development, though; I'm genuinely fascinated by the rapidly evolving fields of Artificial Intelligence and the versatility of Python, always looking for ways to integrate these passions into my projects and learning.
	</p>

	<p>
		Beyond the screen, I'm all about embracing life's adventures. There's a special kind of freedom I find in hitting the open road on a self-drive tour, exploring new destinations, and soaking in different cultures. These experiences not only recharge me but also offer fresh perspectives that often find their way back into my work.
	</p>

	<p>
		At the heart of it all, my biggest motivation is my family. I believe in working diligently and smartly to support them and build a life filled with joy and security. This space is where I'll be sharing some of those moments â€“ the triumphs and challenges from my professional life, the new things I'm learning, insights from my travels, and the everyday occurrences that make life interesting. Expect a mix of tech talk, travelogues, and personal reflections!
